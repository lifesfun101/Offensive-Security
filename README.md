#Offenseve Security

This reposistory is dedicated to offensive security. I only started my journey in that path about 2 months ago. 
I don't claim to know anything, better yet I know nothing about it. Throughout this repository I will be sharing things I found useful myself. These "things" will include: *variety of tools *variety of tactics *variety scripts I possibly wrote *variety of scripts someone else wrote and I found useful (with appropriate creditation), *links to other pages that i stumbled upon *etc. I might eventually post a walkthrough to a few boxes I break, be in hackthebox or vulnhub.
