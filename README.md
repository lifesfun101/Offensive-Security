# #whoami

I'm a young information security professional who enjoys tough problems to solve and new challenges to take on. I have graduated from  college with Information Security Degree and have always been fascinated with this area of Information Technology. In the past I have been on the defensive side of security, working in a Security Operations Center as a Security Analyst.

So far I have 2 certificates under my belt which are OSCP and CISSP (Associate). I enjoy a good challenging box from hackthebox and from vulnhub. I follow many security pages on reddit and attend local security meetups.

This repository is dedicated to offensive security. I started my journey on that path in February, 2019. 
I don't claim to know anything, better yet consider I know nothing about it. Throughout this repository I will be sharing things I found useful myself. These "things" will include:
* variety of tools 
* variety of tactics 
* variety scripts I wrote
* variety of scripts someone else wrote and I found useful (with appropriate creditation) 
* links to other pages that i stumbled upon in my journey and found helpful 
* etc. 

I might eventually post a walkthrough to a few boxes I break, be it hackthebox or vulnhub.

I really hope my contributions on this page will help others along the way and save them quite some time as well
