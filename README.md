# Offensive Security

This repository is dedicated to offensive security. I only started my journey in that path about 2 months ago. 
I don't claim to know anything, better yet consider I know nothing about it. Throughout this repository I will be sharing things I found useful myself. These "things" will include: 
* variety of tools 
* variety of tactics 
* variety scripts I possibly wrote 
* variety of scripts someone else wrote and I found useful (with appropriate creditation) 
* links to other pages that i stumbled upon 
* etc. 

I might eventually post a walkthrough to a few boxes I break, be in hackthebox or vulnhub.

I really hope my contributions on this page, will help others along the way and save them quite some time as well
