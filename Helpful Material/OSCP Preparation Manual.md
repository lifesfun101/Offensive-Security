# Essentials

All the course prerequisites can easily be found on offensive-security's webpage.

A lot of these prerequisites can be learned or reviewed on cybrary.com or codeacademy.com
  
  *Cybrary has a lot of free courses, Codeacademy has some free courses but mostly subscription based.

#### A solid understanding of TCP/IP:

TCP/IP and Subnet Masking - [youtube presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkNq4TrHP_U)

#### Networking: 

Cybrary's Cisco CCNA course - https://app.cybrary.it/browse/course/cisco-ccna

#### Reasonable Linux skills:

A collection of *nix Sysadmin Test Questions and Answers - https://github.com/trimstray/test-your-sysadmin-skills

#### Familiarity with Bash scripting along with basic Perl or Python is considered a plus:

Bash - https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line

Python - https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python

#### Basic Penetration Testing Learning Resources:

Book: "Penetration Testing: A Hands-On Introduction to Hacking" (my review of it can be found at [Helpful Books](https://github.com/lifesfun101/Offensive-Security/blob/master/Helpful%20Material/Helpful%20Books.md))

Cybrary: Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking - https://www.cybrary.it/course/ethical-hacking/
          
          * Introductory course to the basics of ethical hacking/penetration testing

Cybrary: Advanced Penetration Testing - https://www.cybrary.it/course/advanced-penetration-testing/
          
          * I discovered this course much later than reading the book mentioned above. 
            The course basically follows the exercises in the Penetration Testing book 
            and is narrated by the book's author, Georgia Weidman. It's always nice to have 2 ways of learning.

Cybrary: Web Application Penetration Testing - https://www.cybrary.it/course/web-application-pen-testing/
          
          * Introductory course to web application vulnerabilities such as SQL Injections, Cross Site Scripts and 
            Local File Inclusion/Remote File Inclusion. It also goes over Report Creation.

After going through the resources above one should have a basic understanding of penetration testing , some tools and techniques (at least I did).

      * Buffer Overflows were a little confusing to me, but this tutorial made it really easy. 
      Also if you follow the Advanced Penetration Testing course on Cybrary 
      or/and read Penetration Testing: A Hands-On Introduction to Hacking, Georgia Weidman also has good step by step example of this.
