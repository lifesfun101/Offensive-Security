#### Basic Penetration Testing Learning Resources:

Book: "Penetration Testing: A Hands-On Introduction to Hacking" (my review of it can be found at [Helpful Books](https://github.com/lifesfun101/Offensive-Security/blob/master/Helpful%20Material/Helpful%20Books.md))

Cybrary: Penetration Testing and Ethical Hacking - https://www.cybrary.it/course/ethical-hacking/
          * Introductory course to the basics of ethical hacking/penetration testing
Cybrary: Advanced Penetration Testing - https://www.cybrary.it/course/advanced-penetration-testing/
          * I discovered this course much later than reading the book mentioned above. The course basically follows the exercises in the
            book and is narrated by the book's author, Georgia Weidman. It's always nice to have 2 ways of learning.
Cybrary: Web Application Penetration Testing - https://www.cybrary.it/course/web-application-pen-testing/
          * Introductory course to web application vulnerabilities such as SQL Injections, Cross Site Scripts and 
            Local File Inclusion/Remote File Inclusion. It also goes over Report Creation.
